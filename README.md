To apply the basic concepts on Graph Theory and Complex Networks a practical case is analyzed in this exercise. During the exercise, data on football match results through history will be analyzed using the said concepts and conclusions will be drawn upon them.

## 1. Structure:

### Part 1:
1. Download the **football match dataset** from Kaggle.
   - **Link**: [International football results dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/data)
   - **Title**: International football results

2. Create a **complex network** where the **nodes** represent the **national teams**, and the **edges** represent the matches played between them. Consider this a **directed network**, distinguishing between **home** and **away teams**. This network is also a **multigraph**.

### Part 2:
1. **Characterize** the network you have created, analyzing the following parameters:
   - Centrality
   - Degree
   - Clustering
   - Assortativity
2. Write descriptions and conclusions as **comments** in the notebook.

### Part 3:
1. **Visualize** the network or a part of it using the **networkx** and **matplotlib** libraries.
2. The visualizations may display a **subset of nodes and edges** for better comprehension. Nodes must be **labeled**.
3. Describe the steps you followed as **comments** in the notebook.
